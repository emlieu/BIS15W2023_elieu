## Lab 14 Binder
If you want to return to the binder, find the [repository and instructions here](https://github.com/hehouts/lab14_binder)

## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

```r
#A bachelor's degree is required for this; it is a growing occupation since job outlooks are increasing by 36% within the following decade(much faster than average). 
```

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

```r
#In my own terms, I would describe myself in the data science equivalent of the primal ages where cave people just discovered what fire is and how to not burn themselves like 50% of the time. 
#On a resume, I would advertise my abilities to tidy data, create plots and maps, construct apps, as well as build and manipulate data frames. 
```


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

```r
#I am interested in the general biotech, biopharm, and lab research type field. R skills will support this career path because it is a baseline for biologists, especially those in research or some tech type field that deal with data. 
```


4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

```r
#For me, the most difficult part of the field is the step between realizing what the question wants and figuring out what to actually type when you have to turn steps of solving the question into actual functions you know. After that, I can usually remember how to format the functions and such. The most rewarding thing is seeing the little green bar on the side of the chunk after trying like 10 times and seeing red. 
```


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

```r
#I wish I knew my laptop a bit better because this class made me realize I probably don't even know half of what my laptop's capabilities actually are besides using web browsers and playing games.
```


6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

```r
#I would like to know more about turning the code and whatever I type into a website like the one giving directions at our first lab. I also wanna know how I can put pictures(like "real" pictures not like a graph I made) into this hypothetical website.
```


7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

```r
#In my head I think it would be awesome and girlboss to learn more languages like python or c++, but on the other hand this stuff is kinda hard bro ;-; like I do want to learn more about r and my next language I'd want is python, but I don't think other classes here are formatted like ledford's(where the incentive is to learn to learn and not to learn for a grade) so I think that turns me off from taking other coding classes here. If I were to pursue coding further it would probably be on my own time (which is limited).
```

```r
# *leans back in chair and takes a sip of fruity girly non-alcoholic bev*
#Well if you really must know, my plans are to graduate after long nights of drinking coffee, not sleeping, and crying so hard my face is snotty and I fight the urge to throw up. Then I will work my capitalist slave life until I have the funds(thanks to my #notsponsored R coding skills!) to move to Seattle with my partner and live our dual-income-no-kids lifestyle where we have cats and use only the good toilet paper on the off-chance our bidet doesn't work. Life is good and we read books together at cafes, where the light seeps through the curtains and dapples on the table. 
```


8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

```r
#I think having a partner was very important for my success and understanding because I enjoyed the reassurance of having someone to check my work with and for general moral support. I think it was especially reassuring during the midterms because I could work with more confidence in the first half knowing I had someone to ask questions to later. 
#If this turned into an online class I think I would be not as engaged and would be less inclined to ask for help/support. 
```


9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

```r
#You bet your bottom dollar I did girl! I appreciate you too :)
```
